Put your logo in the `static` directory and add it in the config

```toml
[params]
logo = '<you file name>'
logo2x = '<your file name>'
```

You can actually add four versions of the logo:
* `logo`
* `logo2x` a high resolution version of the logo
* `logoDark` logo for dark mode
* `logoDark-2x` high resolution logo for dark mode
